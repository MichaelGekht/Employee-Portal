## Our Work Principles:
• We do not steal time or resources. We provide feedback. We speak openly. We set clear goals. 
We do not look for and do not accept excuses; we find ways to achieve our goals.
>
• We do not complain. Especially in front of our customers.
>
• We offer solutions. We take responsibility. We are held accountable for the consequences of our 
decisions.
>
• We do amazing work. We do not settle for less.

## Our Ways of Work:
• We take pride in our adherence to the Agile philosophy, and we successfully apply the Scrum 
framework in our practice. This approach lets us achieve excellent results in the conditions of a 
rapidly changing market. [More about Scrum you can read here](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/ManagementDocuments/tree/main/ProcessStandards/ScrumArtifacts) 
>
• We hold both ourselves and our team members to a high standard. We support continuous 
learning and every member of our team must upskill on an annual basis.
>
• Our company adheres to established technical standards and common rules of development, 
testing, integration, and DevOps. These standards provide us with a unified approach to our 
work and help us achieve high product quality. [More about technical standards you can read here](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/ManagementDocuments/tree/main/TechnicalStandards)
>
• Quality is the product’s capability to satisfy the client’s requirements and expectations. It is the 
duty of every team member to provide high product quality. Low quality is unacceptable. Our 
principle is: “The product is not considered to be high quality until we have proof of said 
quality.” This means that every stage of the development and testing processes must be 
accompanied by objective quality checks and confirmations. [More about quality assurance you can read here](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/ManagementDocuments/blob/main/ProcessStandards/QualityAssurance.md) 

## Internal Communication
1. Slack: Add full name and last name in English. Specify your role and add your phone number.
2. Github: Add your name and last name to the account. Profile picture and other information 
are optional.

## Our company follows the principles of effective, open communication, the basis of which are: 
1. Mutual respect.
>
2. Adherence to ethical norms  and communication code :
>
**A. We speak politely and honestly.** If something is going wrong, the situation must be dis-
closed in a professional, open form. When a problematic situation comes up, our main 
goal is to establish clarity and correct it.
>
**B. We speak constructively.** We steer discussions in the direction that will help us achieve 
our goals and will lead us to clear conclusions and decisions.  
>
**C. We react to our colleagues’ messages, especially to urgent messages and questions.** If 
we have nothing to say on the matter at hand, we show respect and awareness, leaving a 
reaction to the message.
>
**D. We do not complain.** We approach discussions in a stable emotional condition, leaving 
emotions outside of work.
>
**E. We do not discuss politics.** This is not an appropriate topic to discuss at work. 

## Acceptable reaction speed:
**24 Hours:** Maximum amount of time allowed for:
>
Confirmation that the information about a problem or task has been received.
>
Assignment and acceptance of decision/execution responsibilities.
>
Establishment of the deadline by which the result is promised if such has not already 
been assigned.
>
**2-3 Days:** The time within which we expect initial task results or the start of tangible correction of a problematic situation.
>
**1 Week:** The maximum time allotted for a typical company task.
>
**1 Month:** Time until the ultimate solution of the problem, or until the delivery of the final result.
The maximum time allowed for notification of the emergence of a problem is within 24 hours of the
discovery of a problem, no later than 1/5 of the time delegated to work.

## Several important facts that you must know:
1. **We value results, not effort.** Working for the sake of being busy, but without achieving results, 
is a waste of time, effort, team potential, budget, and our customers’ trust. You can read why
“I tried” is bad, and what needs to be done when faced with such a situation [here](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/ManagementDocuments/blob/main/Behavior/WhyITriedIsBad.md)
>
2. **The company has a concrete position:** To hide information that describes the real state of 
things, and to refuse to admit that things are not going as they should, is to deprive everyone
of the opportunity to fix the situation as early as possible and minimize the damages.  You can 
read about uncomfortable information and how it must be delivered [here](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/ManagementDocuments/blob/main/Behavior/Whistleblowing.md)
>
3. **If there is something you don’t know** – it is your responsibility to find the necessary information. If you could not find it, ask someone who might know. The same goes for feedback 
– it is your responsibility to both provide and request it. [More about feedback](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/ManagementDocuments/blob/main/Behavior/Feedback.md)
