**If you take a vacation, sick leave, or day off, don't forget to notify the team.** 

It is important to give at least one month's notice!

# How to take a vacation?

1. Coordinate the vacation with your manager, team, customer, and HR. Specify the dates of the vacation + who can replace you during your absence (if necessary).

2.  You get a general "OK" - and go on vacation 

**Vacation pay comes with your paycheck on the last day of the month**

To find out how many vacation days you have left - write to Polina Molchanova
