# Compensation for workplace equipment

At Gehsoft we understand how important it is to have a comfortable workplace and serviceable equipment, so we have a system of compensation.

## 1000$ on equipment

After successful completion of the probationary period, we can compensate up to $1000 for the purchase of new equipment.
Important! Compensation is in the format of a refund for the purchase.

**To do this you need to:**

Step 1: Buy the necessary equipment 
>
Step 2: Send a check with proof of purchase to Pavel Emelyanov 
>
Step 3: Wait for reimbursement
>
Reimbursement will come with your paycheck on the last day of the month.

## Reimbursement for workplace equipment

A workstation can wear out, a chair can break, and a desk can become uncomfortable. That's why with each new year of work, an employee can count on our support - we will reimburse you for workstation upgrades. 
Important: you can renew your workplace once a year.

**How does it work?**

The limit for workplace upgrades is $1,000
Step 1: Work at the company for a year/two/three years or more 
>
Step 2: Upgrade your workstation

Step 3: Send a check with proof of purchase to Pavel Emelyanov.

Reimbursement will come with your paycheck on the last day of the month.

## Compensation for relocation to another region

When you relocate to another region by transfer - the company will pay your moving expenses and allocate 1 to 3 salaries for settling in. 
Important: you must have a probationary period.
Since the situation is individual for everyone, write to Pavel Emelyanov to find out how it will work in your case.
